Computers became faster, cheaper, and more accessible between 1957 and 1974. Machine learning algorithms improved and, in 1970, one of the hosts of DSPRAI told Life Magazine that there would be a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being in three to eight years. Despite their success, computersâ€™ inability to efficiently store or quickly process information created obstacles in the pursuit of artificial intelligence for the next ten years.
